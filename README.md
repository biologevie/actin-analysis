# actin-analysis
Actin meshwork simulation and expansion density analysis scripts. 

Dependencies: 
lineprofileanalysis.m requires MATLAB's Signal Processing Toolbox and Image Processing Toolbox

meshworkgenerator as is requires export_fig function (https://github.com/altmany/export_fig) but this can be removed if desired. Image Processing Toolbox is also necessary.
